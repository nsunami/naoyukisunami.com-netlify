Hi! I'm a Social Psychology Ph.D. candidate at the University of Delaware. I study how people connect with each other and regulate a sense of belonging. My recent work focused on how people respond to social rejection using behavioral and physiological measures. I advocate practices improving replicability, reproducibility, and openness.  I'm currently working at [Close Relationship and Health Lab](http://projectclose.com/) with my mentor, [Lisa Jaremka](http://lisajaremka.com/).
