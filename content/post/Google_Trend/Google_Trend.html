<h1>Background</h1>
<p>Stay-at-home orders for COVID-19 forced people to stay at home. Anecdotal and media reports suggested that people consumed more and more video games during the lockdown. Below, I will use the Google Trend Data for the topic Video Game in the US to visualize how the interests in video games increased during the lockdown compared with the previous years, and the number of states who declared a stay-at-home order.</p>

<p>I used data from <a href="https://trends.google.com/">Google Trend Scores</a>. I chose the topic <code>Video Game</code> (Topic ID: <code>%2Fm%2F01mw1</code>, rather than using a specific search term, to get the overall search interests in this topic. The data included the Google Trend scores from 2016-01-03 to 2020-10-18. I downloaded data using the <code>gtrendsR::gtrends()</code> function.</p>
<p>To get the number of states that were under a stay-at-home order, I used the table from the Wikipedia entry, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state_and_local_government_responses_to_the_COVID-19_pandemic">“U.S. state and local government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic”</a>. I had to do some manual cleaning on this. The file is available as <code>wikipedia.csv</code> in the data folder.</p>

<h1>Results</h1>
<p>The plot shows the Google Trend Scores for the topic <code>Video Game</code> on the y-axis. The x-axis represents months of a year. The colored lines represent the years. The gray line represents the number of stats on a stay-at-home order on a given date in 2020.</p>
<p>The upward spikes of the Google Trend Scores seem to correspond with the upward spike of the number of stay-at-home order states (Mid-March to April). Both the Google Trend Scores and the number of stay-at-home order states remained high until May. Then, the interest in video games seems to take on a decreasing trend as some states started to reopen, while they remain higher than those in the pre-COVID years.</p>
<p>The Google Trend scores in 2020 so far did not exceed with the highest scores observed in November and December in 2015-2020 (probably corresponding with the holiday shopping seasons).</p>
