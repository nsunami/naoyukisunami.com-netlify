abstract: Poor quality romantic relationships increase risk for health problems; elevated
  systemic inflammation is one promising underlying mechanism. This registered report
  utilized data from three publicly available data sets with large sample sizes (Add
  Health, MIDUS, NSHAP) to test this possibility. An internal meta-analysis across
  all three studies determined that romantic relationship distress was unrelated to
  inflammation (assessed via C-reactive protein levels). In addition, this link was
  not moderated by gender, socioeconomic status (SES), or the combination of gender
  and SES.
